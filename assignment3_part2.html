			<h1>El Chapo, Escaped Drug Lord, Has Been Recaptured, Mexican President Says</h1>

			<p>The arrest came after an intense gun battle Friday morning in the city of Los Mochis, a seaside area in Mr. Guzmán’s home state of Sinaloa.</p>

			<p>The mission began shortly before 5 a.m. Friday, the Mexican authorities said, after an anonymous tip came in from a citizen concerned about armed men in a nearby home.</p>

			<p>The authorities said they went to the house, where they were fired upon. The operation was conducted by Mexico’s most-trusted military wing, the Marines, which captured Mr. Guzmán in early 2014, before his escape last July.</p>

			<p>It is unclear whether the government knew Mr. Guzmán was in Los Mochis, or whether his capture was a fortunate coincidence. Another leader of Mr. Guzmán’s Sinaloa cartel managed to escape, the authorities said, in the first indication that the gun battle involved high-ranking members of the cartel.</p>

			<p>The capture of the fugitive drug lord concludes a deeply embarrassing chapter for the government of Mr. Peña Nieto, which has been waylaid by a series of security and corruption scandals that reached their low point with Mr. Guzmán’s daring escape.</p>
		</div> 
		<div class="col"> 
			<p>Now, a looming question is whether the Mexican authorities will try to hold Mr. Guzmán for a third time — he has already escaped from prison twice — or whether they will hand him over to the Americans.

			Mr. Guzmán stunned the world last summer when he stepped into the shower in his cell — in the most secure wing of one of the most secure prisons in Mexico — and abruptly vanished in full view of a video camera. When guards entered the cell, they discovered a small hole in the shower floor, through which Mr. Guzmán had disappeared.

			The opening in the shower led to a mile-long tunnel to a construction site. The tunnel was more than two feet wide and more than five feet high, tall enough for Mr. Guzmán to walk through standing upright — his nickname translates to Shorty — and was burrowed more than 30 feet underground.

			It had been equipped with lighting, ventilation and a motorcycle on rails. Some engineers estimated that the tunnel took more than a year and at least $1 million to build.</p>
